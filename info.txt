there are two ways to include JS in html:
1. using <script> tag in the html file inside <head>
2. using javascript file and linking it in the html file (<script src="app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>)


for input and output use: [alert] and [prompt]

VanillaJS

vanilla as a word is used in industry denotes it has no flavour to it: there is nothing added on top of it..
It is the purest form of something.

VanillaJs is the most basic form of Javascipt without any frameworks or library.

-----------

In javascript it is preferred to include <script> at the end of the <body>. This is because the HTML file be rendered from top to bottom and its is best practise to render script at the end.

-----------

<button> [HTML element]
We need to have a reference to this button inside Js using querySelector().
[Using this reference we can style the html using Js. (DOM scripting)]

The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector. [CSS selectors select HTML elements based on id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes etc.]

querySelector is a way to tell your browser that you need the 'element' which has [id=""] ['#' is an id selector in js]
Here we are talking to browser through the 'document.querySelector' API.

API - Application Programming interface
If you want to program an application you use this interface.
The end user is not an user, it is a program here.
When you are talking to a program(app) (and you want to program something into it) you can use API.
When you need to make the app understand you need to use APIs.

Ex: readlineSync (API) used to talk to Node js.
Ex: document.querySelector is an API you can use to talk to document (DOM) of a browser.
Ex: addEventListener is an API which is used to add an event to a HTML element.

-----------

Users interact with an app by clicking, scrolling etc. To listen to this events we can use addEventListener to fetch these "actions" from the app (buttons, scroll over etc.)


Event Listener
btnTanslate.addEventListener("action", clickEventHandler)

Callback: when an event ("click") happens call this funciton. [here a function is used to call on another function when the event happens]

function clickEventHandler() {
    console.log("clicked!")
}    


[Book: Eloquent Javascript]


-----------

To take input from "textarea" tag, reference it in app.js using its id="" and using clickEventHandler take and store the input value from textarea to  a variable in the JS app for further processing.

    The Document Object
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.

The document object is the root node of the HTML document.

The document object is a property of the window object.

The document object is accessed with:

window.document or just document
]


DOM: Document Object Model (API)
Every element on an html page is represented as a property of an object. This object is called Document Object Model (DOM) as it models the entire HTML document in an object.
 Thus to access these properties we use 'methods' like document.querySelector()

[Object is a data structure in Js. It consists of an array of "key:value" pairs.] [Everything in Js is an Object.] [When you create a new object the 'keys' become the properties of that object]
[Accesors for object property are done using the (.) accessor]

[
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a 'programming interface' for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as 'nodes and objects'; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

    A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an 'object-oriented' representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.


]

----------

Everything you do on a webpage triggers an event.

You can plug your own callback or functionality in each of these and introduce custom behavior.

query for following elements:
tag = "tagname"
class = ".classname"
id = "#idname"
element with attribute = "elementname[attribute name=""]"

Fun examples of browser scripting (and querySelector): 
accepting multiple requests on socials.
refereshing and chekcing and booking movie tickets on sites.

-------------

<div id="output"> to give output using outputVariableJS.innerText = "sentence";
<textarea col= >
.innetText = ""

--------------

innerHTML:

document.createElement()

document.createTextNode()

- insertBefore()
- appendChild()

[
    Making a call to the server - Server is where you do heavy processing and also where you save data. 

    This is how you and others view your updates on different clients.

    This is called Client Server Architecture - Client requests or submits data, and Server maintains data.
]

Network call from browser

Talking to server: call a mock server
using: Postman
calling API from Browser: address bar for GET requests

calling API using Js: using fetch(url). This returns Json file as a response file from [app] server.

 When you get a repsonse: 
 .then(response => response.json) [convert response (Readable Stream) to json to read the file data processed by the app]
 After that:
 .then(json => {
    var translatedText = json.contents.translated;
    outputDiv.innerText = translatedText; // output
 }) [take the json, access the tranlsated field from the data and output to app]

[
    Promise: I am geting this data from server but not sure when server would respond - so once i get it will give it you - what should i do then - console.log

    => Arrrow Functions in Js:

    constructURL(textVariable) {
        return "https:/" + "?" + "text=" + textVarible
    }

    fetch() - browser API. Used to fetch promises and then call a function to process it.

    IT says you can go ahead with other execution  and dont wait on me. I will let you know when i get the data.

    This is extremely important in browser. You dont want your user to not be able to click on something or everything to stop when browser is getting data. This is asynchronous programming.

    After data received - give it a call back inside the .then() of promise.

    .then - means that take return value of previous function as an input.

    function doFetch(textVariable) {

        fetch(constructURL(textVariable))
        .then(repsones => response.json())
        .then(json => console.log(json))
    }
]


Ex:
constructURL(text)

TO catch erros define a function to console "error occured"
function errorHandler(error) {
    console.log("error occured", error)
}
.catch(errorJandler)

here argument for errorHandler is taken from the callback function in fetch

'=>' Arrow syntax to define functions [callback]. [arrow functions in Js]
