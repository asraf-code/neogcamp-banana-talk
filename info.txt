there are two ways to include JS in html:
1. using <script> tag in the html file
2. using javascript file and linking it in the html file (<script src="app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>)


for input and output use: [alert] and [prompt]

VanillaJS

vanilla as a word is used in industry denotes it has no flavour to it: there is nothing added on top of it..
It is the purest form of something.

VanillaJs is the most basic form of Javascipt without any frameworks or library.

In javascript it is preferred to include <script> at the end of the <body>.

<button>
We need to have a reference to this button inside Js using querySelector().
[Using this reference we can style the html using Js. (DOM scripting)]

querySelector is a way to tell your browser that you need the 'element' which has [id=""] ['#' is an id selector in js]
Here we are talking to browser through the 'document.querySelector' API.

Callback: when an event happens call this funciton. [here a function is used to call on another function when the event happens]
function clickEventHandler() {
    console.log("clicked!")


Event Listener
btnTanslate.addEventList("action", funciton() {})

DOM: Document Object Model
Every element on an html page is represented as a property of an object. This to access thise propertties we use methods like document.querySelector()

Everything you do on a webpage triggers an event.

You can plug your own callback or functionality in each of these and introduce cutome behavior.

query for following elements:
tag = "tagname"
class = .classname
id = #idname
"element with attribute = elementname[attribute]"

Fun examples of browser scripting: 
accepting multiple requests on socials.
refereshing and chekcing and booking movie tickets on sites.
