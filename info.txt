1. using <script> tag in the html file
2. using javascript file and linking it in the html file (<script src="app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>)


for input and output use: [alert] and [prompt]

We need to have a reference to this button inside Js using querySelector().
[Using this reference we can style the html using Js. (DOM scripting)]

querySelector is a way to tell your browser that you need the 'element' which has [id=""] ['#' is an id selector in js]
Here we are talking to browser through the 'document.querySelector' API.
